SAFE CLI Security Toolkit

A lightweight, educational command-line tool written in Python 3 that demonstrates local password security concepts. It’s fully offline (no external network activity) and built only with the standard library.

✨ Features

Estimates strength on a 0–100 scale

Calculates entropy (bits) and rough brute-force crack time

Provides improvement tips (length, symbols, digits, etc.)

Strong Password Generator:

Creates secure random passwords (8–128 characters)

Configurable: uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols

Option to save generated passwords to a file

String Hasher:

Hash any string with MD5, SHA1, SHA256, or SHA512

Optional salt for stronger uniqueness

Saves results as JSON lines if desired

Mock Login Simulator:

Local demo of a username/password login system

Shows incorrect attempt handling, lockouts, and cooldowns

Useful for illustrating rate-limiting concepts
